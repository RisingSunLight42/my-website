            As you probably already know, I've been a writer at heart from the beginning, even before I was someone who loved lore, roleplaying, or anything else.
            Soutsu's story has been around for quite some time now (he's a pretty old character, after all, as of March 3, 2019).
            Nothing can really be found on the internet anymore, and I even lost the original files due to some superb corruption, but I've already written a lot in the past.
        </p>
        <p class="m-5 mbot-15">
            <span class="italic">Everything was in Soutsu's original universe by the way :3</span>
        </p>
        <p class="justify m-5 mbot-15">
            So it was obvious that I would eventually pick up the pen I'd abandoned so long ago.
            This is something that's quite difficult for me. I haven't written seriously for well over a year now,
            and all the drafts/well-advanced projects have disappeared from my disks with the infamous corruption. Although I have a very good memory, rewriting something
            identically is impossible, and this has frustrated me deeply.

        <p class="justify m-5 mbot-15">
            It's difficult for many reasons. Among them is burnout. You may have noticed, but I disappeared from streaming a few months ago, 
            a lot of things I was more or less teasing never happened, and overall, everything stopped (yes, streaming was supposed to resume the week of May 26, 2025, 
            but my internet connection decided otherwise). 
            I refused to admit for a long time that I was in a state of burnout; in fact, I think I really admitted it to myself once I came out of it.
            I posted a thread talking about it on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/RisingSunLight2/status/1893709623317659762">see here</a>), and I can assure you, I'm feeling much better.

        <p class="justify m-5 mbot-15"><span class="bold">This time I will be careful, I will take the time I need for each project.</span></p>
        <p class="justify m-5 mbot-15">Anyway, I've said it all, let's get to the main topic.</p>

        <h2 class="m-5">Soutsu's Origins, vol 1 : Black and White</h2>
        <p class="justify m-5 italic mbot-15">
            Where the infinity of universes, multiverses, and more lie, lay a still-young tower. Barely created, it had only existed for a short time, but
            the anomaly it represented was already more than enough to intrigue a most singular creature. One desperately sought the one who could
            paint many worlds within its floors; the other sought knowledge and power. It was from these wishes that the contract was born.
